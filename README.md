**🚗 Car Rental System – C++ & MySQL**

This project is a simple yet powerful Car Rental System built using C++ with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and integrated with a MySQL database for efficient data management.
The goal of this system is to simulate a real-world car rental service, providing functionality to manage cars, customers, bookings, and payments – all from a console-based interface. It’s ideal for learning how C++ can be used in real-life applications and how to combine it with database systems for persistent storage.

**💡 Key Features**

🔐 User Authentication (Admin/Customer login system)
🚘 Car Management (Add, update, delete, and view available cars)
👤 Customer Management (Register new customers and manage their data)
📅 Booking System (Rent and return cars with date handling)
💾 Database Integration (All data is stored and retrieved from MySQL)
📦 OOP Architecture (Organized into classes like Car, Customer, Rental, and Admin)

**🛠️ Tech Stack**

C++ – Core application logic and interface
OOP – Modular and maintainable code structure
MySQL – Backend database to store persistent records
MySQL Connector/C++ – To connect C++ with MySQL
